# Physics AI Tutor - Misconception Detection System

## Project Overview
An AI-powered physics tutor designed to identify and correct common misconceptions in AP Physics 1.

## Research Question
Can a specialized AI tutoring system reduce common physics misconceptions more effectively than general-purpose AI assistance?

## Target Misconceptions
1. Heavier objects fall faster
2. Force equals velocity
3. Action-reaction forces cancel out
4. Acceleration and velocity are the same
5. Objects at rest have no forces

## Methodology
- Pre-test students on physics misconceptions
- Group A: Uses specialized AI tutor
- Group B: Uses general AI (ChatGPT)
- Post-test both groups
- Compare improvement rates

## Expected Impact
Students using the specialized tutor will show 20-30% greater improvement in understanding physics misconceptions.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.14
- Anthropic Claude API
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- Pandas (for data analysis)

## For ISEF 2027
