# This file contains the 5 most common misconceptions we're targeting

MISCONCEPTIONS = {
    "heavy_falls_faster": {
        "name": "Heavier Objects Fall Faster",
        "wrong_idea": "Students think heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones",
        "correct_concept": "In the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate ( g = 9.8 m/s^2)",
        "example_student_error": "A bowling ball will hit the ground before a feather"
    },

    "force_equals_velocity": {
        "name": "Force equals Velocity",
        "wrong_idea": "Students confuse force with velocity or think F = v",
        "correct_concept": "Force causes acceleration (F = ma), not velocity",
        "example_students_error": "If there's no force, the object stops moving"
    },

    "action_reaction_cancel": {
        "name": "Action-Reaction Forces Cancel",
        "wrong_idea": "Students think Newton's 3rd law forces cancel each other out",
        "correct_concept": "Action-reaction pairs act on different objects, so they don't cancel",
        "example_student_error": "The forces are equal and opposite, so nothing moves"
    },

    "acceleration_velocity_same": {
        "name": "Acceleration and velocity Are The Same",
        "wrong_idea": "Students use acceleration and velocity interchangeably",
        "correct_concept": "Velocity is rate of position change, acceleration is rate of velocity change",
        "example_student_error": "The car is accelerating at 60 mph"

    },

    "rest_means_no_forces": {
        "name": "Object at Rest Has No Forces",
        "wrong_idea": "Students think an object at rest has no forces acting on it",
        "correct_concept": "Forces can be balanced (net force = 0), but forces still exist",
        "example_student_error": "The book on the table has no forces on it"
    }
